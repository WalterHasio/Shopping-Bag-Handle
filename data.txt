Sliding style bag clip, inspired by pictures I've seen of other sliding bag clips.  There are several companies that make clips of this style, but I think Gripstic* (as pointed out by gspence in the comments below) is the originator of the commonly available designs sold in the US.

I added some longer clip designs that can be printed horizontally.  They include a small amount of support material built into the design that should be removed after printing.
